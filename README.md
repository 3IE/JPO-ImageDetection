## Description

The idea of this project is to detect certain objects/scene in real life, and to add ARKit elements on top of them.

## Demo

A small demo of what it looks like:

- A XWing and an animation are added when the bottom of the mac is detected
- Three floating islands are added when the board in the background is detected
